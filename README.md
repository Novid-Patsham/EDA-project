# EDA-project

### EDA done on nyc-taxi-trip-duration dataset from kaggle and ML models applied to predict trip duration given other variables. Data preprocessing and cleaning done based on EDA.

### Algorithms used :

1) Benchmark model using linear regression
2) KNN Regressor
3) Linear Regression with regularization
4) Decision tree 

### Bar plot compares the performance scores of all the algorithms
